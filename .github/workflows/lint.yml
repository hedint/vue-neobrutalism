# .github/workflows/lint.yml

name: Lint Pull Request

# Controls when the workflow will run
on:
  pull_request:
    branches: [ main ] # Or [ master ] if that's your main branch
    # You can also trigger on specific paths if only certain changes need linting
    # paths:
    #   - 'src/**'
    #   - 'package.json'
    #   - '.eslintrc.js'

jobs:
  lint:
    name: Run Linter
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest # Use the latest Ubuntu runner

    steps:
      # 1. Checkout the code from the pull request branch
      - name: Checkout code
        uses: actions/checkout@v4

      # 2. Set up the environment (REPLACE with your language/tool setup)
      # Example for Node.js:
      - name: Set up Node.js
        uses: actions/setup-node@v4
        with:
          node-version: '20' # Specify your desired Node.js version
          cache: 'npm' # Cache npm dependencies

      # 3. Install dependencies (REPLACE with your package manager install command)
      # Example for Node.js/npm:
      - name: Install dependencies
        run: npm ci # 'ci' is often preferred in CI for deterministic installs

      # 4. Run the linter (REPLACE with your actual lint command)
      # Example for Node.js (ESLint/Prettier):
      - name: Run Lint Checks
        run: npm run lint # Assuming you have a 'lint' script in package.json
